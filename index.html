  </script></head><body><h1 id=a-model-of-the-embryo.-morphogens.>1. A model of the embryo. Morphogens.</h1><p>In this section a mathematical model of the growing embryo will be described. This model will be a simplification and an idealization, and consequently a falsification. It is to be hoped that the features retained for discussion are those of greatest importance in the present state of knowledge. The model takes two slightly different forms. In one of them the cell theory is recognized but the cells are idealized into geometrical points. In the other the matter of the organism is imagined as continuously distributed. The cells are not, however, completely ignored, for various physical and physico-chemical characteristics of the matter as a whole are assumed to have values appropriate to the cellular matter. With either of the models one proceeds as with a physical theory and defines an entitycalled ‘the state of the system’. One then describes how that state is to be determined from the state at a moment very shortly before. With either model the description of the state consists of two parts, the mechanical and the chemical. The mechanical part of the state describes the positions, masses, velocities and elastic properties of the cells, and the forces between them. In the continuous form of the theory essentially the same information is given in the form of the stress, velocity, density and elasticity of the matter. The chemical part of the state is given (in the cell form of theory) as the chemical composition of each separate cell; the diffusibility of each substance between each two adjacent cells rnust also be given. In the continuous form of the theory the concentrations and diffusibilities of each substance have to be given at each point. In determining the changes of state one should take into account</p><ol><li><p>The changes of position and velocity as given by Newton’s laws of motion.</p></li><li><p>The stresses as given by the elasticities and motions, also taking into account the osmotic pressures as given from the chemical data.</p></li><li><p>The chemical reactions.</p></li><li><p>The diffusion of the chemical substances. The region in which this diffusion is possible is given from the mechanical data.</p></li></ol><p>This account of the problem omits many features, e.g. electrical properties and the internal structure of the cell. But even so it is a problem of formidable mathematical complexity. One cannot at present hope to make any progress with the understanding of such systems except in very simplified cases. The interdependence of the chemical and mechanical data adds enormously to the difficulty, and attention will therefore be confined, so far as is possible, to cases where these can be separated. The mathematics of elastic solids is a welldeveloped subject, and has often been applied to biological systems. In this paper it is proposed to give attention rather to cases where the mechanical aspect can be ignored and the chemical aspect is the most significant. These cases promise greater interest, for the characteristic action of the genes themselves is presumably chemical. The systems actually to be considered consist therefore of masses of tissues which are not growing, but within which certain substances are reacting chemically, and through which they are diffusing.</p><p>These substances will be called morphogens, the word being intended to convey the idea of a form producer. It is not intended to have any very exact meaning, but is simply the kind of substance concerned in this theory. The evocators of Waddington provide a good example of morphogens <span class=citation data-cites=waddington1940organisers>(Waddington 1940)</span>.These evocators diffusing into a tissue somehow persuade it to develop along different lines from those which would have been followed in its absence. The genes themselves may also be considered to be morphogens. But they certainly form rather a special class. They are quite indiffusible. Moreover, it is only by courtesy that genes can be regarded as separate molecules. It would be more accurate (at any rate at mitosis) to regard them as radicals of the giant molecules known as chromosomes. But presumably these radicals act almost independently, so that it is unlikely that serious errors will arise through regarding the genes as molecules. Hormones may also be regarded as quite typical morphogens. Skin pigments may be regarded as morphogens if desired. But those whose action is to be considered here do not come squarely within any of these categories.</p><p>The function of genes is presumed to be purely catalytic. They catalyze the production of other morphogens, which in turn may only be catalysts. Eventually, presumably, the chain leads to some morphogens whose duties are not purely catalytic. For instance, a substance might break down into a number of smaller molecules, thereby increasing the osmotic pressure in a cell and promoting its growth. The genes might thus be said to influence the anatomical form of the organism by determining the rates of those reactions which they catalyze. If the rates are assumed to be those determined by the genes, and if a comparison of organisms is not in question, the genes themselves may be eliminated from the discussion. Likewise any other catalysts obtained secondarily through the agency of the genes may equally be ignored, if there is no question of their concentrations varying.</p><p>There may, however, be some other morphogens, of the nature of evocators, which cannot be altogether forgotten, but whose role may nevertheless be subsidiary, from the point of view of the formation of a particular organ. Suppose, for instance, that a ‘leg-evocator’ morphogen were being produced in a certain region of an embryo, or perhaps diffusing into it, and that an attempt was being made to explain the mechanism by which the leg was formed in the presence of the evocator. It would then be reasonable to take the distribution of the evocator in space and time as given in advance and to consider the chemical reactions set in train by it. That at any rate is the procedure adopted in the few examples considered here.</p><h1 id=mathematical-background-required>2. Mathematical background required</h1><p>The greater part of this present paper requires only a very moderate knowledge of mathematics. What is chiefly required is an understanding of the solution of linear differential equations with constant coefficients. (This is also what is chiefly required for an understanding of mechanical and electrical oscillations.) The solution of such an equation takes the form of a sum <span class="math inline">\(\sum{A e^{bt}}\)</span>, where the quantities <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> may be complex, i.e. of the form <span class="math inline">\(\alpha + i \beta\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> are ordinary (real) numbers and <span class="math inline">\(i = \sqrt{-1}\)</span>. It is of great importance that the physical significance of the various possible solutions of this kind should be appreciated, for instance, that</p><ol><li><p>Since the solutions will normally be real one can also write them in the form <span class="math inline">\(R \sum {A e^{bt}}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\sum {A e^{bt}}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> means ’real part of’).</p></li><li><p>That if <span class="math inline">\(A = A' e^{i \psi}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b = \alpha + i \beta\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(A'\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>, are real, then <span class="math inline">\(R A e^{bt} = A' e^{\alpha t} cos (\beta t+ \psi)\)</span>.</p></li></ol><p>Thus each such term represents a sinusoidal oscillation if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0\)</span>, a damped oscillation if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha &lt; 0\)</span>, and an oscillation of ever-increasing amplitude if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha>0\)</span>.</p><p>The bibliography <span style=background-color:light-gray><code>report.bib</code></span> must respect <a href=http://www.bibtex.org/Using/>BibTeX</a> format.
